// main purpose is to provide mainframe for simulation and graphics





//create world and draw debug window





//place crawler in world






//start simulating crawler in step() function, and "talks" with agent manager

/*starts by sending current data of joints to agent manager in vector of pairs
*waits for learner to do its thing
*receives next wanted position of joints, and begins to move joints accordingly
*??waits couple of physics round to let joints achieve wated position??
*rinse and repeat
